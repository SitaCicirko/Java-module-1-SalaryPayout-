# Java-module-1-SalaryPayout-
We will design an application to create payouts for employees in the company. For this purpose
we will use an abstract class that will allow us to perform this operation
efficiently. We will also use the previously learned Template design pattern.
To efficiently implement application design, let's first consider what
exactly it must contain a program like this:
1. An abstract class - SalaryPayout, which will contain methods
responsible for making the transfer and displaying information about the transfer made
transfer.
2. A class that inherits from the abstract class - SalaryPayoutProcessor, which
will take care of the implementation of the methods declared in the abstract class.
3. Two classes of workers that will represent different kinds of workers
â€“ those who have a fixed salary and employees who are accounted for hours worked.

Using the code created above, create new employee objects:
an employee earning PLN 5 for creating one product,
an employee who earns a basic salary of PLN 2,000 and 20% of this salary if
will make additional sales of any product.
